Welcome to QUICKLB's documentation!
===================================

QUICKLB is a very efficient library that sacrifices optimality for speed.
It shines in distributed applications that have unpredictable unbalanced computational peaks in their domains.
To begin using QUICKLB we refer you to the :ref:`installation` section and the example in the :ref:`examples` section.

API documentation can be found in the :ref:`loadbalancer` section
